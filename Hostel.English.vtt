00:02:19.606 --> 00:02:21.938
- Amsterdam, motherfucker.
- Okay.

00:02:22.108 --> 00:02:23.871
Come on, let's go.
Where are we going?

00:02:24.044 --> 00:02:26.035
Red-light district. Time for sneepur.

00:02:26.213 --> 00:02:28.807
Let's go to the coffee shop first,
then get some sneepur.

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:31.246
Hey, I think the Anne Frank
house is around here.

00:02:34.387 --> 00:02:36.184
Did we come to Europe
just to smoke pot?

00:02:36.356 --> 00:02:37.880
I came all the way from Iceland.

00:02:38.058 --> 00:02:40.652
- Yeah, what if we did?
- We did that every day in college.

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:42.988
Why not, like, you know,
check out a museum?

00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:45.131
No, you're right.
We should go to a museum.

00:02:45.298 --> 00:02:46.560
How about the hemp museum?

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:52.733
Oli proudly presents...

00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:56.402
...lsabella.

00:02:57.577 --> 00:02:58.839
She's cute.

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:02.379
But we can't rail a girl
who's in a coma.

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.813
I think that's illegal
even in Amsterdam.

00:03:04.985 --> 00:03:07.886
- Hey, I'm just warming up, man.
- Fucking Oli.

00:03:08.054 --> 00:03:10.181
The Icelandic...
Oh, God, how are you?

00:03:10.357 --> 00:03:14.157
You want to get stoned?

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:17.185
- This will wake you up.
- What the fuck?

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.929
This is good Amsterdam shit.

00:03:27.107 --> 00:03:29.507
That's the shit right there, dude.

00:03:29.943 --> 00:03:31.376
Trust me.

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:37.478
Yeah.

00:03:37.651 --> 00:03:39.619
- It's all good, bro.
- Yeah, dude, smoke it!

00:03:41.755 --> 00:03:44.189
- Dude, what happened?
- Any Dutch people in Amsterdam?

00:04:00.407 --> 00:04:01.999
All right, this is my friend, Josh.

00:04:02.175 --> 00:04:04.439
- Well, hello.
- Hi.

00:04:07.213 --> 00:04:09.477
- Do you guys want another round?
- Yes, okay.

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:11.116
Yeah?

00:04:14.988 --> 00:04:17.218
We will be right back.

00:04:20.193 --> 00:04:21.785
- What are you doing?
- What?

00:04:21.961 --> 00:04:26.125
Do you see a single other person
in here with a fucking fanny pack?

00:04:26.299 --> 00:04:27.323
Wait. There's a guy.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.832
Why don't you go have
fanny-pack sex with him...

00:04:30.003 --> 00:04:32.563
...and jizz all over each other's
storage compartments?

00:04:32.739 --> 00:04:35.731
I can't put my passport in my pocket.
It chafes my thighs, bitch.

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:37.638
- All right?
- Yeah.

00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:38.971
Where's Oli?

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.081
He's fucking genius.

00:04:48.521 --> 00:04:51.684
Sneepur alert, 3 o'clock.

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:54.089
- She smokes.
- Dude, it's Europe!

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.627
Every fucking chick smokes.
Stop being a pussy.

00:04:57.797 --> 00:05:00.766
You are so easy sometimes.

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:05.332
The power of the pack is yours.
I'm out of here.

00:05:12.912 --> 00:05:14.402
I'm sorry.

00:05:14.581 --> 00:05:16.811
Yeah, l...
No, I don't even speak Dutch.

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:19.076
No, I'm sorry, l...

00:05:19.252 --> 00:05:21.982
Get off me, you fucking
faggot-ass elf. Fuck off.

00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:23.747
- Hey, what the fuck?
- Hey. Hey.

00:05:23.923 --> 00:05:25.686
Come on, faggot.

00:05:28.595 --> 00:05:31.689
- Fucker!
- Get your fucking hands off me.

00:05:31.865 --> 00:05:34.390
- I'm an American, I got rights.
- Get the fuck out.

00:05:34.567 --> 00:05:37.866
- Your fucking club sucks ass, bro.
- Kiss my American ass, fucker.

00:05:38.037 --> 00:05:39.868
- Fuck you.
- Let's get out of here, bro.

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:42.007
Hey, I don't know why
you guys are waiting.

00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:45.338
It's a fucking fag fest in there.
Wall-to-wall fucking cock.

00:05:45.512 --> 00:05:47.912
You need one of these
to get in, bro. Sorry.

00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:49.571
That shit was classic, dude.

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:52.741
He was gonna throw down
with a 400-pound Dutchman.

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:55.285
I'm fucking awesome!

00:05:56.055 --> 00:05:57.283
I don't fucking know what...

00:05:57.457 --> 00:06:00.290
I thought you were a Jew, man.
This guy's a fucking Israeli!

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.018
You are fucking Israeli.

00:06:03.062 --> 00:06:05.929
Oh, God, I hope bestiality
is legal in Amsterdam...

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:09.125
...because that girl's a fucking hog.
Look at that, man.

00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:11.629
Hey, guys,
I think she likes me, man.

00:06:11.805 --> 00:06:15.104
Oh, look at that.
Josh, my gift to you, man.

00:06:15.275 --> 00:06:19.075
Thanks, but paying to do whatever
you want to someone isn't a turn-on.

00:06:19.245 --> 00:06:22.612
How are you gonna get over your chick
if you don't bang some new pussy?

00:06:22.782 --> 00:06:25.046
You can't go home
without getting some hot chick.

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:27.243
I agree, but I shouldn't
have to pay for it.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.479
Hey, come on, I'm paying, man.

00:06:55.348 --> 00:06:56.906
Hey.

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:59.379
Are you okay?

00:07:00.587 --> 00:07:03.351
Hello? Hello?

00:07:08.495 --> 00:07:11.521
Hey, close the door.
You watch, you pay.

00:07:11.698 --> 00:07:13.393
Sorry. Jesus.

00:07:13.967 --> 00:07:15.730
You're up, slugger.

00:07:16.536 --> 00:07:20.199
Man, I'm fucking... I'm tired, man.
I can, like, barely stand up.

00:07:20.373 --> 00:07:22.364
Josh, you want
to be a fucking writer?

00:07:22.542 --> 00:07:25.306
How about some life experience,
right there in that room.

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:30.446
- What do we have in here?
- Hey, you watch, you pay.

00:07:30.617 --> 00:07:33.051
I pay. I pay, man. Come on.

00:07:41.661 --> 00:07:42.650
Hey.

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.957
Come, sit.

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:52.199
Your friends are so funny.

00:07:52.906 --> 00:07:54.737
Yeah.

00:07:55.675 --> 00:07:59.270
You can wash over here, by sink.

00:08:14.193 --> 00:08:15.751
It was fine.

00:08:16.029 --> 00:08:19.157
What do you mean? That bitch had
the best fucking tits in Amsterdam.

00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:21.562
It was fine. It was whatever.

00:08:26.306 --> 00:08:28.001
What was that?

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:31.143
- It's fucking after curfew, man.
- Curfew? What are we, 13?

00:08:31.311 --> 00:08:34.872
Let us the fuck in,
we're freezing our balls off.

00:08:35.048 --> 00:08:37.642
We paid to stay here.
They can't just, like, lock us out.

00:08:37.817 --> 00:08:39.079
This is bullshit.

00:08:39.252 --> 00:08:40.480
Hello?

00:08:40.653 --> 00:08:42.245
Open the fucking door.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.252
- What did you tell him?
- He just told them to let us in.

00:08:53.099 --> 00:08:55.192
- Shut up!
- Jesus.

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:58.132
Shut the fuck up,
you fucking Americans.

00:08:58.304 --> 00:09:00.135
Hey, I know what to do.

00:09:04.277 --> 00:09:05.710
Shut up.

00:09:07.046 --> 00:09:09.606
Hey, hey, guys. Up here.
Climb quickly.

00:09:10.149 --> 00:09:11.878
Come on.

00:09:12.185 --> 00:09:13.209
Go. Go, go, go.

00:09:20.893 --> 00:09:22.383
Oh, don't mind them.

00:09:22.962 --> 00:09:26.420
They are so fucked up they don't
know what planet they are on.

00:09:28.701 --> 00:09:31.295
- Thanks, bro.
- It's no problem.

00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:34.463
Not everyone
want to kill Americans.

00:09:35.475 --> 00:09:37.067
Paxton.

00:09:40.179 --> 00:09:42.443
Alexei. But call me Alex.

00:09:42.615 --> 00:09:47.211
What's up, Alex.
This is Josh and Oli.

00:09:47.654 --> 00:09:49.417
Guys, this is fucking awesome, man.

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:52.149
I'm the first in line for sneepur.

00:09:53.626 --> 00:09:56.220
Oh, that's Icelandic for "clit."

00:09:57.664 --> 00:10:00.531
Clitoris or clitoris,
however you wanna say that.

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:01.758
Women have it.

00:10:01.934 --> 00:10:05.961
It's, like, right near the labia.
Like, it hangs.

00:10:06.139 --> 00:10:09.336
Oh, yeah.
Very good sneepur in Iceland.

00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:11.909
- Yeah.
- Come on, guys, have a seat.

00:10:19.752 --> 00:10:21.185
Where you travel to?

00:10:21.354 --> 00:10:24.517
We started in Paris,
which is where we met this drifter.

00:10:24.691 --> 00:10:26.283
Anyway, we went all over France...

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:29.394
...and then Switzerland, Belgium,
and now we're in Amsterdam.

00:10:29.562 --> 00:10:32.053
Yeah, kind of over Amsterdam.
Way too many Americans.

00:10:32.231 --> 00:10:35.257
Yeah, but Oli's got a friend
with a flat in Barcelona...

00:10:35.435 --> 00:10:38.632
...and he's supposed to hook us up
with some hot-ass seÃ±oritas.

00:10:39.138 --> 00:10:40.765
Looking for girls?

00:10:42.875 --> 00:10:44.103
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:10:45.344 --> 00:10:47.710
So talk to Alex.

00:10:48.181 --> 00:10:51.776
He open up the pussy
all over the Europe.

00:10:51.951 --> 00:10:53.111
I can help you.

00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:57.020
Oh, shit.
Alex is a pimp, apparently.

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:00.315
Thanks, bro,
but I think we'll be okay.

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:01.960
- Yeah.
- Good.

00:11:08.034 --> 00:11:09.729
You looking for girls like this?

00:11:19.011 --> 00:11:21.980
These are fucking magnificent.

00:11:23.116 --> 00:11:26.017
- Who the hell are these girls?
- You have to go east, my friend.

00:11:26.185 --> 00:11:28.244
This is where the best girls are.

00:11:28.421 --> 00:11:29.752
The best.

00:11:29.922 --> 00:11:31.753
How far east?

00:11:31.924 --> 00:11:34.859
You can go as far as Ukraine,
around Odessa.

00:11:35.862 --> 00:11:38.990
These girls I met
at this one hostel in Slovakia...

00:11:39.165 --> 00:11:40.757
...just outside Bratislava.

00:11:41.334 --> 00:11:44.360
The girls there are so hot
you cannot believe it.

00:11:45.271 --> 00:11:48.172
And they love anyone foreign,
especially American.

00:11:48.574 --> 00:11:50.940
They hear your accent,
they fuck you.

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:54.273
So wait, this place
is near Bratislava?

00:11:54.447 --> 00:11:55.539
Josh.

00:11:56.215 --> 00:11:58.513
You won't find this hostel
in any guidebook.

00:11:59.252 --> 00:12:02.847
Barcelona, so many Americans.

00:12:03.022 --> 00:12:05.149
But Slovakia? No one there.

00:12:05.324 --> 00:12:09.226
There is so much pussy, and because
of the war, there are no guys.

00:12:09.662 --> 00:12:12.688
You go to this hostel,
you will have any girl you want.

00:12:12.865 --> 00:12:15.459
They go crazy for any foreigner.

00:12:15.635 --> 00:12:17.398
You just...

00:12:18.805 --> 00:12:20.534
...take them.

00:12:48.534 --> 00:12:50.331
Fuck, man.

00:12:53.172 --> 00:12:56.369
Can't you keep your Viking ass
in your pants for, like, two seconds?

00:12:56.542 --> 00:12:58.339
Hey, man, I shaved my ass
just for you.

00:12:58.511 --> 00:13:00.570
- Okay, all right.
- My Viking balls too.

00:13:00.746 --> 00:13:02.179
Okay, stop.

00:13:14.126 --> 00:13:15.650
I'm sorry.

00:13:15.828 --> 00:13:17.352
My daughter.

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:19.521
She miss her daddy,
and Daddy miss her.

00:13:19.699 --> 00:13:21.291
Yeah, no problem, dude, it's cool.

00:13:25.071 --> 00:13:27.164
- Saskia.
- Cute.

00:13:27.673 --> 00:13:31.302
- She's adorable.
- She's a little cutie, yeah.

00:13:33.079 --> 00:13:35.547
This is Svanhildur, my daughter.

00:13:35.715 --> 00:13:37.273
- Very pretty.
- She's 6.

00:13:37.917 --> 00:13:39.475
She's starting school this year.

00:13:40.186 --> 00:13:42.086
Wait, you have a daughter?

00:13:42.255 --> 00:13:45.088
Yeah, of course, my horse.
I was married for eight years.

00:13:46.559 --> 00:13:48.857
Okay. All right.

00:13:49.028 --> 00:13:51.792
- You are on vacation?
- Yeah, we're backpacking.

00:13:51.964 --> 00:13:53.431
Our next stop is Bratislava.

00:13:56.168 --> 00:13:59.069
- What?
- Slovakia.

00:14:00.907 --> 00:14:02.875
You will like it.

00:14:03.142 --> 00:14:05.474
Casino, girls.

00:14:07.647 --> 00:14:10.673
You can pay to do anything.

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:12.613
Anything.

00:14:13.653 --> 00:14:16.645
- How are the girls?
- Very beautiful.

00:14:17.256 --> 00:14:20.157
They will love you.
Handsome American like you.

00:14:22.328 --> 00:14:25.820
Handsome devil. He is handsome.

00:14:26.699 --> 00:14:29.862
That's... That's awkward.
That's awkward.

00:14:38.277 --> 00:14:40.404
That's awkward too.

00:14:42.181 --> 00:14:45.241
- You need a fork there, chief?
- No, no, no.

00:14:45.418 --> 00:14:47.943
I prefer to use my hands.

00:14:48.821 --> 00:14:50.516
I believe...

00:14:50.823 --> 00:14:54.657
...people have
lost their relationship with food.

00:14:56.028 --> 00:14:57.393
They do not think:

00:14:57.563 --> 00:15:01.226
"This is something who gave its life
so I would not go hungry."

00:15:01.968 --> 00:15:05.301
I like to have a connection
with something that died for me.

00:15:05.471 --> 00:15:06.870
I appreciate it more.

00:15:08.074 --> 00:15:09.507
Well, I'm vegetarian.

00:15:09.675 --> 00:15:12.143
And I am a meat-eater.

00:15:12.311 --> 00:15:14.245
It's human nature.

00:15:15.181 --> 00:15:17.376
Well, I'm human,
and it's not in my nature.

00:15:18.351 --> 00:15:21.081
Tell me, what is your nature?

00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:24.355
Don't touch!
Don't fucking touch me!

00:15:24.824 --> 00:15:26.416
I'm sorry.

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:29.293
Excuse me.

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:32.363
Fucking freak.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.258
Jesus.

00:15:39.071 --> 00:15:41.904
Edward Saladhands
just groped Josh.

00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:45.807
Dude, you finally hooked up.
That's awesome.

00:15:46.112 --> 00:15:48.410
Yeah, that's fucking hilarious.

00:16:53.579 --> 00:16:55.274
Or we could visit some factories.

00:16:56.682 --> 00:16:58.081
Should be cool.

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:00.081
In this area...

00:17:00.252 --> 00:17:04.780
...we make plastic for Slovakia.

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:08.087
Is that so?

00:17:30.516 --> 00:17:32.245
Look at this.

00:18:15.928 --> 00:18:19.227
- Nice, eh?
- This is a fucking hostel?

00:18:20.366 --> 00:18:22.630
Holy shit.

00:18:28.741 --> 00:18:31.676
You can have that, man.
I'm too scared.

00:18:35.814 --> 00:18:37.679
Hey, hey. The party has arrived.

00:18:39.018 --> 00:18:41.578
- You are saved from boredom.
- Let me guess.

00:18:41.754 --> 00:18:45.190
You must be
the King of the Swing.

00:18:45.357 --> 00:18:47.587
You made a reservation under
"King of the Swing?"

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.523
- Yeah, of course, my horse.
- I'm sorry.

00:18:49.695 --> 00:18:53.563
- He doesn't get out of his cage much.
- I can see that.

00:18:56.235 --> 00:18:58.032
Here are your keys.

00:18:58.304 --> 00:19:01.137
You leave your passports
at the desk.

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:08.070
That was taken when I was like 13.
I was kind of husky.

00:19:08.247 --> 00:19:09.612
Not anymore, though, you know?

00:19:09.782 --> 00:19:12.751
Do you have any private rooms?
We're probably gonna need them.

00:19:12.918 --> 00:19:17.082
The rooms are semiprivate,
so you will have roommates.

00:19:17.256 --> 00:19:20.157
Roommates, huh? That's gay.

00:19:28.133 --> 00:19:29.566
Sorry.

00:19:30.002 --> 00:19:33.130
- Oh, my God.
- It's okay.

00:19:33.305 --> 00:19:36.240
The room is yours.
We are going to the spa.

00:19:38.744 --> 00:19:40.575
You should come.

00:19:44.416 --> 00:19:46.179
Spa.

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:02.965
Jugs.

00:20:06.639 --> 00:20:09.005
- Hey.
- Hello.

00:20:09.174 --> 00:20:11.165
Oh, Jesus.

00:20:13.212 --> 00:20:15.271
- Hi. Hey.
- Hi.

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:20.284
How you doing?

00:20:23.322 --> 00:20:26.120
I'm so happy I shaved my balls.

00:20:28.227 --> 00:20:31.390
What? I have the smoothest balls
in Iceland.

00:20:31.563 --> 00:20:34.623
- You wanna see?
- No, no, no, you're not... I'm good.

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.064
Put your anteater away,
it's totally creepy.

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:41.471
- You're not from Iceland, no?
- No. Fuck, no. American.

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:44.336
Yeah, unlike him,
I had my foreskin removed at birth.

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:47.140
Hygiene and... Am I talking?

00:20:47.546 --> 00:20:50.071
- I'm Josh.
- Natalya.

00:20:50.382 --> 00:20:52.509
- And this is Svetlana.
- Hi.

00:20:53.152 --> 00:20:54.847
Hi, I'm Paxton.

00:20:55.354 --> 00:20:58.016
- And this is Oli.
- The King of the Swing.

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:00.788
Hello.

00:21:02.127 --> 00:21:04.288
Face on the ass. Never gets old.

00:21:04.463 --> 00:21:05.930
Jesus.

00:21:06.098 --> 00:21:08.032
So where are you girls from?

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.464
I'm from Italy,
but my parents are Russian.

00:21:10.969 --> 00:21:12.698
Prague.

00:21:13.672 --> 00:21:16.664
Prague's cool. Kafka.

00:21:17.176 --> 00:21:20.304
So, Natalya...

00:21:20.479 --> 00:21:23.107
- Yeah?
- You're Russian, eh?

00:21:44.636 --> 00:21:48.299
Oh, my God.
Look, there are too many girls.

00:21:51.677 --> 00:21:54.305
- This is awesome.
- Yes.

00:22:35.521 --> 00:22:37.989
I mean, I was a senior,
you know, she was a junior...

00:22:38.157 --> 00:22:40.557
...and then I graduated,
and it was weird, you know.

00:22:40.726 --> 00:22:45.095
I mean, I'm totally over it.
It's... You know, it's cool.

00:22:45.264 --> 00:22:46.697
It's okay.

00:22:46.865 --> 00:22:48.389
Look, Vala is here.

00:22:48.567 --> 00:22:52.059
- Who?
- Vala, from front desk. Vala.

00:22:53.372 --> 00:22:56.136
- All right, Oli.
- Hey, I told you, man.

00:22:56.308 --> 00:22:58.401
I'm the King of the Swing.

00:22:58.944 --> 00:23:01.913
Come, let's dance.

00:23:09.822 --> 00:23:12.655
- Does the cigarette bother you?
- No, it's...

00:23:12.825 --> 00:23:14.588
I put away.

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:17.024
It's fine, I...

00:23:17.196 --> 00:23:20.097
I'm gonna go get some fresh air.

00:23:20.365 --> 00:23:23.266
But I'll be back, okay?

00:23:45.557 --> 00:23:46.785
Cigarette.

00:23:47.893 --> 00:23:49.360
Cigarette.

00:23:49.895 --> 00:23:51.089
Aren't you a little young?

00:23:51.263 --> 00:23:53.060
- Dollar.
- What?

00:23:53.699 --> 00:23:54.961
Dollar.

00:24:00.372 --> 00:24:02.567
- Dollar.
- Here you go.

00:24:10.382 --> 00:24:12.316
Here, children commit
the most crime.

00:24:12.751 --> 00:24:15.879
They don't care.
They will attack anyone.

00:24:16.455 --> 00:24:19.083
- You're okay?
- Yeah, yeah. Thank you.

00:24:21.527 --> 00:24:23.552
Hey, let me buy you a drink.

00:24:23.829 --> 00:24:25.262
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

00:24:26.865 --> 00:24:28.799
Hey, Josh.

00:24:28.967 --> 00:24:30.434
Faggot.

00:24:30.769 --> 00:24:33.237
Go with your friends. It's okay.

00:24:33.405 --> 00:24:35.236
I wanted to say sorry about earlier.

00:24:35.407 --> 00:24:37.432
About the way I reacted.

00:24:37.943 --> 00:24:39.604
We cool?

00:24:44.416 --> 00:24:47.647
I would have done
the same thing at your age.

00:24:49.855 --> 00:24:51.914
It's not easy...

00:24:52.524 --> 00:24:54.754
...but from my experience...

00:24:54.927 --> 00:24:58.260
...choosing to have a family
was the right choice for me.

00:25:00.632 --> 00:25:01.963
Now I have my little girl...

00:25:02.134 --> 00:25:05.900
...who means more to me
than anything in the world.

00:25:06.738 --> 00:25:09.730
But you should do...

00:25:09.908 --> 00:25:12.274
...whatever's right for you.

00:25:14.446 --> 00:25:17.506
Excuse me, it's my turn now.

00:25:33.265 --> 00:25:35.096
Should we be doing this
with them there?

00:25:35.267 --> 00:25:37.064
Yeah, it's okay.

00:25:38.637 --> 00:25:42.801
- Yeah, baby. Josh, give it to me, baby.
- Okay, all right. Okay, stop!

00:25:42.975 --> 00:25:45.443
- All right.
- Come on, big boy.

00:25:45.611 --> 00:25:48.011
- We go to spa.
- Spa.

00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:50.842
Spa, spa, spa.
Being dirty while getting clean.

00:25:51.016 --> 00:25:52.574
Bye.

00:27:18.303 --> 00:27:20.066
Mission accomplished.

00:27:23.308 --> 00:27:27.176
You know that Amsterdam kid
with the thing on his lip?

00:27:27.345 --> 00:27:30.075
I'm gonna send him
a really nice thank-you note.

00:27:30.782 --> 00:27:32.374
Be quiet.

00:27:36.221 --> 00:27:38.485
They're showering together.

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:43.758
Shit, man. We're never leaving here.

00:27:45.664 --> 00:27:47.529
I guess Oli's not back yet.

00:27:47.699 --> 00:27:50.463
No, dude, he probably
took that desk girl home.

00:27:50.635 --> 00:27:52.159
We'll see him at breakfast.

00:28:05.984 --> 00:28:10.182
- What's the name?
- Oli Ericson, 237.

00:28:13.125 --> 00:28:15.719
How are we supposed to
understand this without subtitles?

00:28:15.894 --> 00:28:17.020
Fucking gay.

00:28:17.195 --> 00:28:19.220
Yeah, he checked out this morning.

00:28:19.898 --> 00:28:21.798
You mean he took his
passport to go out?

00:28:21.967 --> 00:28:24.333
No, it say he checked out
this morning.

00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:27.500
- When this morning?
- I don't know exact time.

00:28:27.672 --> 00:28:29.833
I could find out tomorrow.

00:28:36.148 --> 00:28:39.049
Hey, Oli, it's Pax.
Are you still with that chick?

00:28:39.217 --> 00:28:41.151
Can I leave a note
in case he comes back?

00:28:41.319 --> 00:28:43.344
Okay, cool. Yeah.

00:28:46.591 --> 00:28:48.149
All right.

00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:55.695
He's probably still with Vala.
When she call me, I call you, okay?

00:28:55.867 --> 00:28:57.664
Okay.

00:28:57.836 --> 00:28:59.394
- We see you later, right?
- Yeah.

00:29:00.071 --> 00:29:01.663
Okay.

00:29:02.741 --> 00:29:03.969
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

00:29:04.142 --> 00:29:08.806
Oli, hey, it's me again.
We're gonna go into town, so call us.

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:10.641
You're gay.
Damn voice mail again.

00:29:10.816 --> 00:29:14.013
- Hi! Hi! Hi!
- Hi.

00:29:14.186 --> 00:29:15.881
Your friend.

00:29:17.155 --> 00:29:20.215
- What the hell?
- Your friend, my friend.

00:29:20.392 --> 00:29:22.257
What does that say?

00:29:23.295 --> 00:29:24.956
Sayonara. Your friend.

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:26.757
What, they left? Like, together?

00:29:26.932 --> 00:29:29.833
That doesn't make any sense.
Oli doesn't even like Asian girls.

00:29:30.001 --> 00:29:31.593
I mean, no offense, but...

00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:33.294
When did she send this to you?

00:29:33.471 --> 00:29:35.598
This picture. Today?

00:29:36.141 --> 00:29:39.076
Could you do me a favor
and send this picture to my phone?

00:29:39.244 --> 00:29:40.233
This picture.

00:29:42.614 --> 00:29:43.979
That water looks fucking cold.

00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:46.674
You know, if you fell in,
you'd die in 90 seconds.

00:29:46.852 --> 00:29:49.286
Dude, did I tell you I saw
a girl drown when I was 8?

00:29:49.955 --> 00:29:52.253
- Where?
- Lake Michigan.

00:29:52.424 --> 00:29:57.361
It was fucked up, man.
This little girl, probably 4 or 5.

00:29:57.729 --> 00:30:01.187
We made eye contact,
which was a weird thing, you know...

00:30:01.366 --> 00:30:03.960
...and she was yelling for me
to help her.

00:30:04.135 --> 00:30:05.500
Yeah? What did you do?

00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:09.504
I ran to the lifeguard, who was busy
talking to her boyfriend at the time...

00:30:09.674 --> 00:30:12.234
...and I yelled, you know,
"There's this girl drowning."

00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:15.277
And she couldn't see her.
Probably thought I was making it up.

00:30:15.447 --> 00:30:19.474
And then a second later all you could
hear was this horrible screaming.

00:30:19.951 --> 00:30:22.249
It was that little girl's mother, dude.

00:30:22.954 --> 00:30:24.353
Her kid was dead.

00:30:24.823 --> 00:30:27.587
- Jesus.
- I had nightmares for years after that.

00:30:27.759 --> 00:30:31.490
I mean, I'd wake up every fucking
night hearing that mother scream.

00:30:31.663 --> 00:30:33.255
I just...

00:30:33.431 --> 00:30:35.228
I just felt like I could have
done more.

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:37.994
You did the right thing.
Could've been a double drowning.

00:30:38.169 --> 00:30:40.399
Yeah, well, I didn't see it
that way at the time.

00:30:40.572 --> 00:30:44.201
All I knew was this little girl was dead
and her mother's life was ruined.

00:30:44.376 --> 00:30:46.537
What makes you think of this now?

00:30:50.715 --> 00:30:51.773
Bubble gum.

00:30:52.984 --> 00:30:55.714
- Sorry, kid.
- No, no. Give him some.

00:30:59.391 --> 00:31:01.222
What are you doing?

00:31:02.327 --> 00:31:04.887
These fucking kids are dangerous.

00:31:05.664 --> 00:31:07.131
Hey, Oli.

00:31:07.299 --> 00:31:09.494
- Hey, Oli.
- Hey.

00:31:12.137 --> 00:31:14.037
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:31:14.205 --> 00:31:17.504
- Hey, Oli. Hey!
- Oli!

00:31:22.514 --> 00:31:24.311
It's your lucky day, Josh.

00:31:24.482 --> 00:31:26.109
A museum.

00:32:11.896 --> 00:32:13.227
How's it hanging?

00:32:15.367 --> 00:32:18.131
- What the fuck?
- Holy shit.

00:32:18.303 --> 00:32:20.271
- He got you.
- Yeah, that's hilarious.

00:32:20.438 --> 00:32:21.666
Okay.

00:32:22.374 --> 00:32:23.932
Hey, Oli.

00:32:25.643 --> 00:32:27.338
Hey, Oli.

00:32:27.512 --> 00:32:28.809
Hey, hey.

00:32:30.715 --> 00:32:32.012
Excuse me?

00:32:32.817 --> 00:32:35.945
I'm sorry, I thought you
were someone else.

00:32:36.121 --> 00:32:38.749
Well, I'm not.

00:32:38.923 --> 00:32:40.515
Where did you get that jacket?

00:32:42.927 --> 00:32:46.454
- Hey, I'm talking to you, man.
- Get your fucking hands off me.

00:32:47.699 --> 00:32:50.759
This is my jacket.

00:33:06.851 --> 00:33:08.512
It's from Oli.

00:33:09.988 --> 00:33:10.977
"I go home"?

00:34:09.714 --> 00:34:12.308
I don't know,
maybe his battery died.

00:34:13.518 --> 00:34:15.952
Hey, Kana, when are you leaving?

00:34:17.255 --> 00:34:20.554
I'm sorry. When are you going away?

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:23.286
Tomorrow, I go.

00:34:23.461 --> 00:34:24.826
Okay, because we may go too.

00:34:24.996 --> 00:34:28.796
Do you wanna go to the train with us?
To the train station?

00:34:30.535 --> 00:34:32.503
Tomorrow, train?

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:34.331
Yeah, yeah.

00:34:37.075 --> 00:34:38.975
- Hello, Josh.
- Hey.

00:34:39.144 --> 00:34:41.078
- Hey.
- Come, we go for disco?

00:34:41.246 --> 00:34:44.943
Actually, I just wanna find my friend
and get the fuck out of here.

00:34:47.352 --> 00:34:50.082
Okay, we'll see you.

00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:59.557
Hey, guys, hold up a sec.
We'll be right out.

00:34:59.731 --> 00:35:01.358
Okay.

00:35:03.801 --> 00:35:06.326
- Josh, come here, dude.
- Yeah, what?

00:35:06.838 --> 00:35:10.069
It's not their fault Oli disappeared,
so stop acting like it is.

00:35:10.241 --> 00:35:12.368
- I'm annoyed he'd ditch us.
- I'm pissed too.

00:35:12.544 --> 00:35:14.034
But we're not in America.

00:35:14.212 --> 00:35:17.147
I mean, people meet each other
and split without saying shit.

00:35:17.615 --> 00:35:19.242
It's just how they do it over here.

00:35:19.417 --> 00:35:22.318
As well as we may think we know Oli,
we don't really know him.

00:35:22.487 --> 00:35:24.387
He could've gone
somewhere with that girl.

00:35:24.556 --> 00:35:27.582
Fuck, maybe he's in Iceland.
The guy's got a daughter.

00:35:27.759 --> 00:35:29.090
So let's look at our options.

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:32.525
We can A, fuck these girls one more
night and then head to Barcelona...

00:35:32.697 --> 00:35:36.030
...or B, not fuck them,
then head to Barcelona anyway.

00:35:36.201 --> 00:35:40.001
Think about it. When I'm studying for
the bar and you're writing your thesis...

00:35:40.171 --> 00:35:42.264
...this is the shit
we're gonna think about.

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:45.500
Okay. All right, he doesn't show up,
it's his problem.

00:35:45.677 --> 00:35:48.009
- It's his problem.
- All right.

00:35:48.179 --> 00:35:50.306
All right.

00:35:50.481 --> 00:35:53.780
Hey, Kana, you wanna go
to the disco with us?

00:35:54.185 --> 00:35:55.709
You know, disco?
Dancing?

00:35:56.788 --> 00:35:58.221
No?

00:36:39.163 --> 00:36:41.256
Josh?

00:36:41.432 --> 00:36:44.196
- I'm gonna go back.
- Are you okay?

00:36:44.369 --> 00:36:45.700
I'm, like... I'm tired.

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:48.430
Actually, I have, like, a headache.

00:36:49.274 --> 00:36:51.367
If you want, I will go with you.

00:36:51.976 --> 00:36:56.037
No, no, no, I'll just see you
back at the room.

00:36:58.082 --> 00:37:00.209
Goodbye.

00:37:05.256 --> 00:37:06.348
Fucking pussy.

00:37:38.856 --> 00:37:40.380
- Josh.
- Vala.

00:37:40.558 --> 00:37:42.389
You don't look well.

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:44.790
- No, l...
- Here, let me help you.

00:37:44.962 --> 00:37:48.022
I feel sick.

00:37:58.543 --> 00:38:01.410
Where is...?
Where is Oli?

00:38:01.579 --> 00:38:03.604
You need rest.

00:38:31.209 --> 00:38:33.302
Where's the restroom?

00:38:33.945 --> 00:38:36.379
Past the bar, in the back.

00:38:43.388 --> 00:38:44.446
You guys cool?

00:38:45.189 --> 00:38:47.555
- Vodka Red Bull.
- Vodka Red Bull, danke.

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:53.897
Yeah.

00:39:34.872 --> 00:39:36.669
Hey!

00:39:37.742 --> 00:39:39.573
Hey!

00:40:02.633 --> 00:40:04.498
Open the door.

00:40:25.256 --> 00:40:27.121
Oh, fuck.

00:40:32.763 --> 00:40:34.253
What the f...?

00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:54.315
Oh, fuck.

00:41:08.699 --> 00:41:11.327
What...? Who are you?

00:41:11.869 --> 00:41:13.496
What the f...? Where the fuck am I?

00:41:13.671 --> 00:41:16.139
What the fuck is this shit?

00:41:17.008 --> 00:41:19.203
Please, please...
Fuck. Please, please, please...

00:41:19.377 --> 00:41:21.607
I didn't fucking do shit to you,
what the fuck!

00:41:23.714 --> 00:41:25.614
Please, please, what the...?

00:41:25.783 --> 00:41:29.219
Please, no, sir.
Please fucking stop. Please!

00:41:29.387 --> 00:41:30.547
What the fuck?

00:41:31.155 --> 00:41:33.385
Please, I didn't fucking do anything.

00:41:34.458 --> 00:41:36.050
What the fuck?

00:41:36.227 --> 00:41:40.254
What the fuck?
This is such fucking bullshit.

00:41:40.431 --> 00:41:41.921
What the fuck is this?

00:41:42.099 --> 00:41:43.930
What? No! No, please don't...!

00:41:44.101 --> 00:41:46.228
What the...?
No, no, fucking don't you... No, no!

00:41:46.604 --> 00:41:49.072
Oh, my God, no, no!
Oh, my fucking God!

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:51.208
Oh, my God! No, no, no, no!

00:41:51.375 --> 00:41:53.639
Oh, please. What the fuck?

00:41:53.811 --> 00:41:56.211
No, no, no, no, fuck! No!

00:42:04.922 --> 00:42:08.153
Fuck! Oh, fuck!

00:42:40.725 --> 00:42:41.953
You.

00:42:47.465 --> 00:42:49.228
Why?

00:42:52.403 --> 00:42:56.271
I always wanted to be a surgeon...

00:42:56.874 --> 00:42:59.672
...but the boards wouldn't pass me.

00:43:00.845 --> 00:43:02.142
Can you guess why?

00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:14.380
You see?

00:43:16.027 --> 00:43:18.257
So I went into business...

00:43:18.429 --> 00:43:21.091
...but business is so boring.

00:43:21.832 --> 00:43:25.859
You buy things, you sell them.
You make money, you spend money.

00:43:26.037 --> 00:43:27.766
What kind of life is that?

00:43:28.472 --> 00:43:30.736
A surgeon...

00:43:30.908 --> 00:43:34.639
...he holds the very essence
of life in his hands.

00:43:34.979 --> 00:43:36.537
Your life.

00:43:36.714 --> 00:43:39.182
He touches it.

00:43:40.685 --> 00:43:43.176
He has a relationship with it.

00:43:43.554 --> 00:43:46.045
He's part of it.

00:43:48.659 --> 00:43:51.457
Please, please.
Just let me go, please.

00:43:51.629 --> 00:43:54.189
You want to go?

00:43:54.699 --> 00:43:57.190
Is that what you want?

00:44:16.253 --> 00:44:18.687
Oh, my God!

00:44:24.762 --> 00:44:27.196
Fuck! Oh, fuck!

00:44:37.942 --> 00:44:39.933
You are free to go.

00:45:04.702 --> 00:45:08.194
Oh, fuck. No!

00:45:08.372 --> 00:45:11.432
No. No, fuck. No, fuck...

00:45:12.476 --> 00:45:15.138
Please, I have money.
I'll fucking pay you.

00:45:15.312 --> 00:45:17.177
Ten times, two times,
whatever you want...

00:45:17.348 --> 00:45:18.747
- Pay me?
- Yes.

00:45:18.916 --> 00:45:20.406
No one is paying me.

00:45:20.584 --> 00:45:24.145
In fact, I am the one paying them.

00:45:34.732 --> 00:45:37.565
Relax. Relax, bro.

00:45:38.002 --> 00:45:39.469
Oh, shit.

00:45:55.519 --> 00:45:57.749
- Two thirty-seven, please.
- Two three seven.

00:45:58.355 --> 00:45:59.583
Didn't you check out?

00:46:00.891 --> 00:46:02.153
No, not yet.

00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:04.050
Not yet.

00:46:04.228 --> 00:46:07.925
- This your bag?
- Yeah.

00:46:08.098 --> 00:46:10.692
The maid brought it here.
You're checked out.

00:46:11.001 --> 00:46:12.593
- I didn't check out.
- It says.

00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:14.431
It happened this morning.

00:46:14.605 --> 00:46:16.732
This is bullshit.
Did somebody leave a note?

00:46:16.907 --> 00:46:18.966
Because I didn't
fucking check out, dude.

00:46:19.476 --> 00:46:22.707
No, man, just this bag.
If it's a mistake...

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:25.440
Yeah, it's definitely a mistake.
We need a fucking room.

00:46:25.616 --> 00:46:28.983
Chill out, man. You're on vacation.

00:46:30.554 --> 00:46:32.181
Two three seven.

00:46:35.492 --> 00:46:38.984
Hey, was there a Japanese girl
waiting in the lobby for somebody?

00:46:39.163 --> 00:46:42.257
No, think they left this morning.

00:46:42.433 --> 00:46:43.923
Yeah.

00:46:46.737 --> 00:46:48.500
I'm sorry, dude.

00:46:56.247 --> 00:46:58.647
Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me.

00:46:59.817 --> 00:47:02.718
It's okay. We are going to the spa.

00:47:02.887 --> 00:47:04.878
You will join us?

00:47:09.693 --> 00:47:11.661
You should come.

00:47:18.302 --> 00:47:20.327
Hey, Josh, call me
soon as you get this, man.

00:47:20.504 --> 00:47:22.734
I got locked in that club.
It was retarded, dude.

00:47:22.907 --> 00:47:24.534
I'm at the hostel.

00:47:27.578 --> 00:47:29.068
Svetlana!

00:47:30.948 --> 00:47:32.882
Svetlana!

00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:04.808
Hey!

00:48:10.955 --> 00:48:12.149
You little fucker.

00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:30.705
Jesus.

00:48:30.874 --> 00:48:32.603
Wait at hostel for your friends.

00:48:32.776 --> 00:48:35.267
They will look for you there
no matter what.

00:48:35.446 --> 00:48:39.712
Yeah, I know. But, see, my friend
Josh is the kind of guy who...

00:48:39.883 --> 00:48:43.683
He just wouldn't check out without
so much as leaving a note, you know.

00:48:44.555 --> 00:48:46.455
He's the responsible one.

00:48:46.623 --> 00:48:49.615
Yeah, but maybe he worried
his belongings get stolen...

00:48:49.793 --> 00:48:51.818
...so he take them when he go out.

00:48:51.996 --> 00:48:54.521
Someone misplace if he leaves note.

00:48:55.165 --> 00:48:56.598
It is not uncommon.

00:48:59.403 --> 00:49:01.928
Yeah, well, is there
anything else that I can do?

00:49:03.273 --> 00:49:05.901
There's nothing right now.

00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:07.538
We have his picture...

00:49:07.711 --> 00:49:10.942
...if we see him, or he is picked up,
or something happen...

00:49:11.115 --> 00:49:13.879
...we contact you at hostel, yeah?

00:49:14.051 --> 00:49:15.518
Okay.

00:49:17.521 --> 00:49:18.988
Where are you from?

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:21.152
California.

00:49:23.093 --> 00:49:25.755
You are so far from home.

00:50:49.279 --> 00:50:52.271
Paxton. Come, have a drink.

00:50:55.419 --> 00:50:58.183
Hello, Mr. American.

00:51:00.424 --> 00:51:02.824
- Did you get my messages?
- Which one?

00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:04.522
There are so many.

00:51:04.695 --> 00:51:07.391
I call you back, but child answer.

00:51:07.898 --> 00:51:09.331
Yeah, I know.

00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:11.058
Have you seen Josh?

00:51:16.039 --> 00:51:17.734
In English, please.

00:51:18.876 --> 00:51:20.605
He is with your friend...

00:51:20.777 --> 00:51:22.642
...the King of the Swing.

00:51:23.247 --> 00:51:26.239
- He's with Oli.
- Why you leave last night?

00:51:26.783 --> 00:51:30.685
Did you not listen to my messages?
I got locked in a storage room.

00:51:30.854 --> 00:51:34.187
I don't know,
I got sick and passed out.

00:51:37.561 --> 00:51:40.496
- What?
- She said you met another girl.

00:51:40.664 --> 00:51:42.529
Where are my friends?

00:51:48.539 --> 00:51:50.564
The art show.

00:51:51.775 --> 00:51:54.335
- You mean like a museum?
- No, no, no.

00:51:55.179 --> 00:52:00.811
Not museum.
They went... How you say, for artist?

00:52:00.984 --> 00:52:04.010
- Exhibit.
- Exhibit for artist.

00:52:04.188 --> 00:52:05.678
No, that doesn't make any sense.

00:52:05.856 --> 00:52:07.517
Why? What is wrong?

00:52:07.691 --> 00:52:10.785
Well, they didn't leave a note.
They didn't call or do anything.

00:52:11.061 --> 00:52:12.426
They tell us to tell you.

00:52:12.596 --> 00:52:14.564
Yeah, but I tried calling them all day.

00:52:14.731 --> 00:52:17.825
Yes, but their phone, the battery die
and they do not have...

00:52:18.001 --> 00:52:20.026
How you say, for electricity?

00:52:20.204 --> 00:52:23.173
Converter. Okay, whatever,
where is this art show...

00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:24.967
...because I wanna go.

00:52:25.142 --> 00:52:26.973
- Have a drink.
- I don't want a drink.

00:52:27.144 --> 00:52:29.305
All right? I wanna see some art.

00:52:29.479 --> 00:52:32.141
Okay? So can we go?

00:52:44.895 --> 00:52:46.157
You're not going?

00:52:46.930 --> 00:52:48.955
I've seen this show.

00:52:55.372 --> 00:52:57.363
You want gum?

00:52:58.075 --> 00:52:59.440
No.

00:53:21.632 --> 00:53:23.190
Too bad for you.

00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:30.900
We are here.

00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:31.827
Are you coming or what?

00:54:33.904 --> 00:54:36.839
Excuse me. Excuse me.

00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:38.505
How is it in there?

00:54:39.910 --> 00:54:41.502
Be careful.

00:54:43.313 --> 00:54:44.644
Why is that?

00:54:45.382 --> 00:54:49.580
You could spend all your money...

00:54:49.986 --> 00:54:51.647
...in there.

00:55:26.923 --> 00:55:28.151
How much is it?

00:55:28.792 --> 00:55:30.419
For you, free.

00:55:47.711 --> 00:55:49.235
There.

00:55:51.081 --> 00:55:52.378
That's the show?

00:55:54.618 --> 00:55:56.176
Yes.

00:56:11.668 --> 00:56:14.296
- What?
- Nothing.

00:56:14.471 --> 00:56:19.340
You're so serious,
Mr. Serious American.

00:57:23.106 --> 00:57:25.165
You fucking whore.

00:57:26.676 --> 00:57:28.337
You fucking bitch.

00:57:28.979 --> 00:57:30.640
You fucking bitch!

00:57:31.982 --> 00:57:34.917
I get a lot of money for you...

00:57:35.085 --> 00:57:38.145
...and that make you my bitch.

00:57:40.824 --> 00:57:44.021
Fuck. Get the fuck off me!

00:57:45.562 --> 00:57:47.689
This is fucked!

00:57:47.864 --> 00:57:49.092
Get the fuck off me!

00:57:49.833 --> 00:57:51.824
Get the fuck off me!

00:58:50.694 --> 00:58:52.127
Fuck.

00:59:21.758 --> 00:59:22.952
Talk.

00:59:26.396 --> 00:59:27.920
Talk. Speak.

00:59:29.232 --> 00:59:31.063
What the fuck
do you want me to say?

00:59:33.003 --> 00:59:34.698
American.

00:59:37.173 --> 00:59:38.572
No. No, wait!

00:59:38.742 --> 00:59:41.108
I'm not fucking American!

00:59:42.012 --> 00:59:45.175
I'm not fucking... Look at me.
I'm not fucking American.

00:59:46.016 --> 00:59:47.608
American.

00:59:50.186 --> 00:59:53.155
Please, what the fuck is this?

00:59:58.395 --> 01:00:01.831
Let me go. Please.

01:00:02.766 --> 01:00:05.701
I promise I won't tell anybody.

01:00:05.869 --> 01:00:09.396
Just please let me go.

01:00:35.665 --> 01:00:37.656
Don't. Don't.

01:00:37.834 --> 01:00:39.529
Please don't.

01:00:49.746 --> 01:00:51.771
Don't, please.

01:00:54.718 --> 01:00:56.310
God.

01:01:28.518 --> 01:01:30.509
Oh, please, stop!

01:01:30.687 --> 01:01:33.485
Please stop it. Please stop it.

01:01:35.058 --> 01:01:37.253
I know you don't wanna do this.

01:01:37.427 --> 01:01:38.894
Please don't do this.

01:05:55.952 --> 01:05:57.351
Fuck.

01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:19.731
Oh, shit.

01:13:24.133 --> 01:13:25.600
What the fuck?

01:13:26.602 --> 01:13:28.035
What do you think?

01:13:29.939 --> 01:13:31.497
How do I look?

01:13:31.674 --> 01:13:34.734
I feel like a butcher or a surgeon
or some shit, know what I mean?

01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:38.744
I feel fucking ridiculous in this thing,
but I guess you need it, huh?

01:13:41.383 --> 01:13:44.375
Yeah. I'll tell you something...

01:13:44.553 --> 01:13:48.512
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Wait a sec.

01:13:49.825 --> 01:13:51.622
How was it?

01:13:56.065 --> 01:13:57.464
Good.

01:13:57.633 --> 01:14:00.966
Well, goddamn, motherfucker,
for this money, it better be. Shit.

01:14:01.136 --> 01:14:03.434
What did you go for, a local?

01:14:03.606 --> 01:14:04.834
What, European?

01:14:06.675 --> 01:14:08.438
- American.
- An Amer...?

01:14:09.178 --> 01:14:12.147
Ain't that a bitch. Big spender.
I fucking... I love it.

01:14:12.314 --> 01:14:15.147
I just fucking love that shit.
You know what they got for me?

01:14:15.317 --> 01:14:17.342
They told me they lined up
something special.

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:19.613
I've been waiting almost a week
for this shit.

01:14:19.788 --> 01:14:21.551
For 50 grand,
she better be worth it.

01:14:21.724 --> 01:14:23.954
But it's supposed to be
a real rush, right?

01:14:24.126 --> 01:14:28.790
It's like... They told me
it's like a real fucking rush, right?

01:14:28.964 --> 01:14:30.488
Come here.

01:14:31.433 --> 01:14:34.300
I've been all over the world.
You know, I've been everywhere.

01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:37.303
And the bottom line is,
pussy's pussy.

01:14:37.806 --> 01:14:41.572
You know, every strip club,
every whorehouse, every...

01:14:41.744 --> 01:14:43.405
It's all the same shit.

01:14:43.579 --> 01:14:47.606
I just fucked a girl two days ago, I don't
even remember the color of her tits.

01:14:47.950 --> 01:14:53.513
But this, this is something
you never forget, right?

01:14:55.291 --> 01:14:56.280
Right?

01:14:58.127 --> 01:14:59.924
- Never.
- Never, right.

01:15:00.963 --> 01:15:03.591
Let me show you something.
Pretty sweet. Check this out.

01:15:03.766 --> 01:15:06.735
What do you think of this?
Come on, let me see yours.

01:15:08.037 --> 01:15:10.938
Come on, let me see yours.
We're all in the same club.

01:15:11.774 --> 01:15:13.264
I'll be out in a second, guy.

01:15:14.243 --> 01:15:17.644
Can I ask you something personal?
Do you mind?

01:15:19.014 --> 01:15:20.242
How'd you do it?

01:15:21.817 --> 01:15:23.114
Did you do it real slow...

01:15:23.719 --> 01:15:26.347
...or did you just get it over with
right away?

01:15:26.522 --> 01:15:28.285
That's why I asked for
the fucking gun.

01:15:28.457 --> 01:15:30.550
Because I just wanted
to fucking do it quick.

01:15:30.726 --> 01:15:32.318
I just wanted to get it over with.

01:15:32.494 --> 01:15:35.088
But now I'm thinking maybe
I wanna feel it, you know?

01:15:35.264 --> 01:15:36.891
I wanna fucking feel that shit.

01:15:37.066 --> 01:15:40.399
So I don't know what to... I'm thinking...
What do you think I should do?

01:15:43.739 --> 01:15:45.536
- Make it quick.
- Make it quick.

01:15:45.708 --> 01:15:47.676
Yes.

01:15:48.344 --> 01:15:50.278
Yeah, that's... No, fuck that shit.

01:15:50.446 --> 01:15:53.711
Fuck this, too fucking American, dude.
I'm going fucking old school.

01:15:53.882 --> 01:15:55.577
Who wants this, motherfucker?

01:15:55.751 --> 01:15:58.447
Who wants this shit?
Come on, motherfucker.

01:15:58.621 --> 01:16:00.316
Bring it.

01:17:28.577 --> 01:17:29.942
Hey, buddy.

01:17:30.112 --> 01:17:32.808
Get your own fucking room.
I paid for this.

01:17:35.684 --> 01:17:37.015
What are you, fucking deaf?

01:17:45.894 --> 01:17:47.191
Kana.

01:17:54.803 --> 01:17:57.863
- Oh, my God.
- What do you want me to do, Kana?

01:18:00.476 --> 01:18:05.072
What? I don't understand
what you're saying. What?

01:18:11.253 --> 01:18:17.453
Fuck. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Hold still. Hold still.

01:18:17.626 --> 01:18:21.926
- Fuck. Oh, God. God.
- No. No!

01:18:22.164 --> 01:18:24.098
- Shit.
- No!

01:18:24.266 --> 01:18:27.633
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:18:45.087 --> 01:18:46.384
Fuck!

01:18:46.555 --> 01:18:47.988
Fuck!

01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:53.489
Fuck!

01:20:09.872 --> 01:20:12.136
We're gonna get the fuck
out of here, Kana.

01:20:36.198 --> 01:20:38.758
Move this fucking truck!

01:22:41.823 --> 01:22:43.051
Fuck.

01:22:55.804 --> 01:22:57.294
We're almost there.

01:23:02.711 --> 01:23:03.939
Oh, my God.

01:23:07.349 --> 01:23:08.611
Oh, no.

01:23:13.155 --> 01:23:14.383
Fuck.

01:24:46.681 --> 01:24:49.172
Kana.

01:24:50.685 --> 01:24:52.482
Kana.

01:25:02.063 --> 01:25:04.031
Come here.

01:25:13.108 --> 01:25:15.941
No. No, Kana. Kana.

01:25:20.282 --> 01:25:21.806
No, Kana.

01:26:16.938 --> 01:26:21.068
No, thank you.
I prefer to use my hands.

01:26:21.443 --> 01:26:24.901
I believe people have lost
their relationship with food.

01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:26.104
They do not think:

01:26:26.281 --> 01:26:29.546
"This is something who gave its life
so I would not go hungry."

01:26:29.718 --> 01:26:34.314
I like to have a connection
with something that died for me.

01:28:19.627 --> 01:28:21.595
Oh, Jesus.

01:28:33.541 --> 01:28:34.565
Goddamn!

01:28:34.743 --> 01:28:36.677
Fucker.

01:29:07.409 --> 01:29:08.774
No, please!

01:33:02.910 --> 01:33:05.845
I get a lot of money for you...

01:33:06.014 --> 01:33:09.142
...and that make you my bitch.
